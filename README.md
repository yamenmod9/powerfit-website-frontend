> 🆕 **NEW!** [📘 Flutter App Updated for Production Dataset](FLUTTER_APP_UPDATED.md) - Complete guide with test credentials and expected data

## 🚀 Quick Start

- **Testing Guide:** [QUICK_START_TEST_GUIDE.md](QUICK_START_TEST_GUIDE.md)
- **Test Credentials:** [TEST_CREDENTIALS.md](TEST_CREDENTIALS.md) - 14 test accounts
- **Expected Data:** [EXPECTED_DATA_GUIDE.md](EXPECTED_DATA_GUIDE.md) - What should appear on screens
- **Documentation Index:** [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) - All 29+ guides

## 🎯 Overview

This Flutter application provides a complete frontend solution for gym management operations, connecting to an existing Flask backend API. The app supports four distinct user roles with tailored interfaces:

- **Owner** - Strategic oversight with multi-branch analytics
- **Branch Manager** - Single-branch operations and performance tracking
- **Reception** - Fast-paced customer registration and subscription management
- **Accountant** - Financial reporting and expense tracking

See [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for complete API reference.

## 📱 Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run app
flutter run

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

## 🌐 Web Deployment

### Local web development

Use the web target during development:

```bash
flutter config --enable-web
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=APP_ENV=development --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=development --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

If you prefer a reusable shell wrapper, copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env` and run:

```bash
bash scripts/build_web.sh
```

### Production build

The production build used for Vercel and CI is:

```bash
bash scripts/build_web.sh
```

This script reads `API_BASE_URL` and `ENVIRONMENT`, then builds the web bundle with `flutter build web --release`.

### GitHub Actions

The workflow at [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) checks out the repo, installs Flutter stable, enables web, runs dependency resolution, analysis, tests when present, builds the web release, and uploads `build/web` as an artifact.

### Vercel deployment

Vercel should serve the generated Flutter web output as a single-page application. The root [vercel.json](vercel.json) file rewrites all routes to `index.html` so browser refresh and direct links do not return 404s.

Use these Vercel settings:

- Install command: `bash install_web.sh`
- Build command: `bash build_web.sh`
- Output directory: `build/web`

### Environment variables

Use these variables for local builds, CI, and deployment settings:

- `API_BASE_URL` - the FastAPI server base URL
- `ENVIRONMENT` - `development`, `staging`, or `production`

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the exact placeholders.

## 🔐 Security

- Secure JWT storage (platform-specific encryption)
- Token expiry validation
- Role-based route guards
- Input validation on all forms
- HTTPS-only communication

## 🎨 Design System

**Color Scheme by Role:**
- Owner: Purple (#9C27B0)
- Branch Manager: Blue (#2196F3)
- Reception: Green (#4CAF50)
- Accountant: Orange (#FF9800)

## 📊 Business Logic

**Health Calculations (Auto-computed):**
- **BMI:** `weight (kg) / height (m)²`
- **BMR:** Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
- **Daily Calories:** BMR × Activity Multiplier

**Subscription Rules:**
- Payment required before activation
- Freeze pauses expiration counter
- Stop = immediate deactivation
- Renewal extends from current end date

**Fingerprint Handling:**
- Text-based hash (NO device biometrics)
- Optional customer identifier
- Manual or backend-generated

## 🧪 Testing

**Production-Quality Test Dataset Available:**

- **14 Test Users** across all roles (Owner, 3 Managers, 6 Reception, 4 Accountants)
- **150 Customers** distributed across 3 branches
- **472 Transactions** totaling 164,521 EGP
- **123 Subscriptions** with realistic statuses

See **[TEST_CREDENTIALS.md](TEST_CREDENTIALS.md)** for complete test account details and scenarios.

**Quick Test Login:**
```
Owner: owner / owner123
Manager: manager_dragon / manager123
Reception: reception_dragon_1 / reception123
Accountant: accountant_central_1 / accountant123
```

**Testing Guide:** See [QUICK_START_TEST_GUIDE.md](QUICK_START_TEST_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step testing instructions.

## 📝 Code Structure

```dart
// Example: Feature Provider Pattern
class ReceptionProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  final ApiService _apiService;
  
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> registerCustomer(...) async {
    // API call
    // Update state
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// Example: Screen with Provider
class ReceptionHomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final provider = context.watch<ReceptionProvider>();
    // UI implementation
  }
}
```

## 🚦 Development Workflow

1. Feature in separate folder under `features/`
2. Provider for state management
3. API service calls with error handling
4. Shared widgets for reusability
5. Run `flutter analyze` before commit

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Advanced charts for Owner dashboard
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Offline mode with sync
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] PDF/Excel export
- [ ] QR code generation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Target of URI doesn't exist":**
```bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

**JWT expired:** App auto-logs out, re-login required

**Cannot connect:** Check internet, verify backend URL
